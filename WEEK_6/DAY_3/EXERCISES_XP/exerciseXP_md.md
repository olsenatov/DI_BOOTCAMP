# Management API app

## 0. Set up:
- Create a new Django project and a new app within the project.

### Models:
- Create four models for the API: Department, Employee, Project, and Task.
- For each model, specify the necessary fields and any relationships between the models. For example, the Department model may have a one-to-many relationship with the Employee model, while the Project model may have a many-to-many relationship with the Task model.

### Serializers:
- Create a serializer for each model using the `serializers.ModelSerializer` class.
- For each serializer, specify the model it represents and the fields to include in the serialization.

## 1.1 Implement CRUD operations using APIView:
In this section, you'll implement the CRUD operations for the departments, employees, projects, and tasks using the APIView from Django Rest Framework.

### Department:
- Use the `DepartmentAPIView` class to handle list, create, retrieve, update, and delete operations for departments.

### Employee:
- Use the `EmployeeAPIView` class to handle list, create, retrieve, update, and delete operations for employees.

### Project:
- Use the `ProjectAPIView` class to handle list, create, retrieve, update, and delete operations for projects.

### Task:
- Use the `TaskAPIView` class to handle list, create, retrieve, update, and delete operations for tasks.

## 1.2 URLs:
- Create a list of path objects named `urlpatterns`.
- Each path object should define a URL pattern that maps to a view. Here's an example for the departments' operations:
```python
path('departments/', DepartmentAPIView.as_view(), name='department-operations'),
```
Repeat this step for all the other views (employees, projects, tasks). Ensure each path object has a unique name, used to identify the URL pattern and can be used for reverse URL lookups.

## What you will learn:
In this exercise, you'll understand how to build a RESTful API using Django. You'll define models, set fields and relationships between models, design serializers, and implement CRUD operations using the APIView from the Django Rest Framework. Additionally, you'll determine how to create URL patterns that link to each view. By the conclusion of the exercise, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of building a RESTful API with Django.
